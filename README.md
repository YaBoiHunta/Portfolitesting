# Portfolio testing

This is My first attempt you could say at a portfolio. A site linking to other pages and etc.

And im trying to put it on git here to learn how to update it from any pc and other stuff.

Trying to learn to set this stuff up and move things around and etc. Hopefully this is a decent start. And maybe i can use this some day to get a job or something.

## Site

I need to find a host or something.

## About

Duh
